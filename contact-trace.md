# Contact Tracing for Covid

## MIT Algorithm

MIT use bluetooth which works inside a train passing through a tunnel - a cellular signal won't work inside the tunnel. The alogrithm is automatic and does not need a user login
to a web site.  Both Apple IoS and Andriod support this algorithn. California (CA) is already using it with help from UC/Berkeley who has setup servers.

## India's Aarogya Setu

Uses cellular signal which has an issue mentioned above against MIT section.  I wish India just trashes Aarogya Setu and uses what MIT developed, espeially since IoS and Android phones add the algorithm to the operating system (OS).
